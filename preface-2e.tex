It is with great pleasure that I present the \emph{second} edition of this book. The major changes  have been the inclusion of some large \emph{stotrās} such as the \emph{Saundarya laharī}, \emph{Sankshepa Rāmāyanam} and \emph{Shiva sahasranāmam}, as well as numerous smaller \emph{stotrās}. The \emph{stotrās} have also now been segregated into two parts, with the longer \emph{stotrās} occupying the second part of the book.

I thank all those who have made use of the previous edition of the book and have given me their feedback, which I hope has helped improve the content in the present edition. I thank my father-in-law, \textit{Shri. N.~Venugopālan}, for sending me the text of some rare \emph{stotrās}. I also thank my wife \textit{Mādhuryā}, for meticulously proof-reading \emph{Saundarya laharī}. I also thank my \textit{Ammā}, for suggesting the wonderful \textit{Durgā pancharatnam}, composed by Mahaperival.

I welcome suggestions for improvements --- please drop me a \textit{gmail} at \textit{karthik.raman} to notify me of any comments/suggestions and even the smallest of errors.
