It is with great pleasure that I present the revised \emph{second} edition of this book. Most of the changes in this version are minor, save for the inclusion of a few more \emph{stotrās}, such as \textit{Kāmākshī suprabhātam}, \textit{Dakshināmūrti ashtakam}, \textit{Santānagopāla stotram}, \textit{Dāmodarāshtakam}, \textit{Āpaduddhārana  dvādaśa mukha hanu\-mān stotram} and \textit{Ranganātha gadyam}, to name a few. Many ~\textit{śatanāma stotras} have been added too; since the number of ~\textit{śatanāma stotras} has exceeded 25, I have now moved them to another part by itself. Several corrections have also been made to many of the stotras, from previous editions. Special thanks to \textit{Sāketh} for proofreading \textit{Gakārādi Ganapati Sahasranāma stotram} and for encoding many of the ~\textit{ashtottara śatanāma stotras}.\\
